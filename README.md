## Description
This project contains the solutions to the exercises of the class "Sysstems Biology of Immunology". In addition, the simulations of the SZR model and its stochastic variant can be found in [zombie_apocalypse_ode.py](https://github.com/Veit21/Systems_Biology/src/zombie_apocalypse_ode.py) and [zombie_apocalypse_gillespie.py](https://github.com/Veit21/Systems_Biology/src/zombie_apocalypse_gillespie.py) respectively. This is the material for the seminar talk and the formulation of the model can be found in ["You can run, you can hide: The epidemiology and statistical mechanics of zombies"](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.92.052801) by A. Alemi et al.
